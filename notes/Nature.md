I told a little lie. Not everything can be a player. Introducing
# Nature.
We all know nature. The rivers flowing, leaves blowing, thunder bolting nature.

The thing about nature is that... it's not a decision-maker. A robot or chimp can sit down and think: "I will play this game according to the rules of the game". Nature, surprisingly, cannot do that. So, for the purposes of game theory, nature, is not a player.

If you were to play a game against nature, you're not really playing against nature, you're just playing a single-player [[Games|game]].
