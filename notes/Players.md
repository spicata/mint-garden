# Players
In [[Game Theory...|game theory]], a **player** is: a party that participates in a game. They can range anywhere from:
- A single person playing a game
- An entire group of people playing a game
- A robot playing a game

That means that a **player** is not restricted to *only* humans, but could be anything. A chimpanzee can be a player, a rudimentary algorithm can be a player, entire countries could be players. [[Nature|The possibilities are endless]].
