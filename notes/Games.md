# Games
We all love them. Not in game theory though.

According to Investopedia, a game is...
> ... any set of circumstances that has a result dependent on the actions of two of more decision-makers

That would make bargaining with your car salesman a game. War would also fit the category of a game. Last time I checked, I wouldn't say that those two are the most entertaining of activities. And there's a plethora of ways to categorise them:
- [[Category by Players|One-player games & two-player games & n-player games]];
- [[Category by Sums|Constant sum & variable sum games]];
- [[Category by Cooperation|Cooperative games & non-cooperative games]];
- [[d|Perfect information games & imperfect information games]];
- [[e|Infinite & finite games]]
