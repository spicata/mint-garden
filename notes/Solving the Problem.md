# Solving the Problem
Clicking the button or not clicking the button, that is the question.

In this problem, our *best* solution depends on what the other player does. If the other player chooses to not press the button, our *best, most profitable*, not the most morally good, would be to press the button. You may come out of the experience feeling worse, but you'll also come out being a millionaire.

On the other hand, if the opponent were to press the button... well, to put it blunt, you're luck has run out. No matter what you do, you're... dead. In that case, do anything you want.

A very simple **"game"** about pushing buttons. **Congrats**, you solved it, and [[Game Theory...|that's what this topic is about]].
