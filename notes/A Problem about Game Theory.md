# A Problem:
**You** are in a room. In front of you is a big, red button. Don't click it yet! Listen to these conditions first:
- There is someone else in a different room who also has a big, red button
- If neither of you click the button: you both get **$500,000**.
- If both of you click it: you both **die**.
- If one of you click it and the other doesn't: the person who didn't, **dies**. You also get **$1,000,000**.

So, what do you do? [[You Clicked It|Click the button]] or [[You Didn't Click it|don't]]
