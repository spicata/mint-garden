That's Britannica's definition, but it could be put much more simple. Essentially:
### Game theory is the study of strategies

Game theory could be used in a variety of places:
- Economics,
- Go (the board game),
- Politics,
- War

Essentially, to apply it, we need some [[Players|people]] and a "game".
