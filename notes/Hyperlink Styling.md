# Hyperlink Styling
I only used 2 different hyperlink style: visited and unvisited.

For unvisited links, I used:
```css
a:link {
	color: white;
}
```
For visited links, I used:
```css
a:visited {
	color: white;
}
```
Pretty simple. For choosing the colour, I just got one accent colour and another colour that was somewhat similar to the colour of the text, but different enough. That's about it.
