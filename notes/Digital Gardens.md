# Digital Gardens...
or if put more accurately, a hypertext garden. A collection of ideas, leading one to another, through [[The Connections|hyperlinks]].
A concept which I learned from [Eastgate](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Introduction.html) credited for the idea of the hypertext garden, though probably older.
It allows the readers to get "lost" in a website, but not truly, as there will be paths that you can take and those you can't.
